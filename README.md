Texas Advanced Computing Center. Game made in processing using TUIO and MPE.

The game allows for multiple phones to connect to cluster-driven tile display (https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/vislab/stallion). The phones act as TUIO (http://www.tuio.org/?processing) servers to broadcast TUIO events to the computers and Processing MPE (https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/research-development/tacc-software/massive-pixel-environment) is used to display the game.

In progress.
